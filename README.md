# THREADS CLONE

This is still a huge work in progress
If you'd like to contribute, fork this repo, create a feature branch and have at it.

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and create a variable exactly named: `VITE_GIPHY_API` and add in your own Giphy API in order for the Gif features to work.

More to come!
